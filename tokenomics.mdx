The X84 token aligns platform incentives between creators, users, and the protocol. It gates premium hosting features, enables governance participation, and captures protocol revenue through buyback mechanisms.

## Token overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Token | X84 |
| Network | Solana (SPL Token) |
| Total supply | 1,000,000,000 (1B) |
| Launch mechanism | Meteora DLMM |

## Allocation

| Category | Allocation | Vesting |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Community & ecosystem | 40% | 24-month linear unlock |
| Team & advisors | 20% | 12-month cliff, 24-month linear vest |
| Treasury | 15% | DAO-controlled after governance launch |
| Liquidity | 10% | Meteora DLMM at launch |
| Strategic partners | 10% | 6-month cliff, 18-month linear vest |
| Initial contributors | 5% | 6-month cliff, 12-month linear vest |

## Revenue streams

x84 generates revenue through six channels:

| Stream | Amount | Stage |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Registration fees** | 0.05 SOL per agent | v1 (launch) |
| **Settlement fees** | 3% of every x402 payment (300 bps) | v1 (launch) — primary revenue driver |
| **NFT royalties** | 5% on secondary market sales | v1 (launch) |
| **Hosting tiers** | Token-gated (hold X84 for Builder tier) | v1 (launch) |
| **LLM pool** | Shared inference with markup | v2 (planned) |
| **Marketplace premium** | Featured listings and promotion | v2 (planned) |

## Token utility

The X84 token serves four primary functions:

1. **Hosting access** — Builder tier requires holding X84 tokens. Grants 10,000 req/day, 10 MCP servers, full analytics, custom domain, and priority marketplace discovery.
2. **Governance** — Token holders vote on protocol parameters: settlement fee rates, registration fees, treasury allocations, and feature prioritization.
3. **Revenue capture** — Protocol revenue (settlement fees, registration fees) flows to the treasury. Governance can direct treasury funds to buyback-and-burn, staking rewards, or ecosystem grants.
4. **Staking** (planned) — Future staking mechanism for validators, premium marketplace placement, and enhanced discovery ranking.

## Governance timeline

| Phase | Milestone | Governance model |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Launch | Token generation event via Meteora DLMM | Team multisig |
| Month 3 | Snapshot voting for parameter changes | Token-weighted off-chain votes |
| Month 6 | On-chain governance program deployment | SPL Governance / Realms |
| Month 12 | Full DAO control of treasury and parameters | Token-weighted on-chain votes |

## Fee parameters

All protocol fees are configurable through governance:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Governor |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| Settlement fee | 300 bps (3%) | 0-1000 bps | DAO vote |
| Registration fee | 0.05 SOL | 0-1 SOL | DAO vote |
| NFT royalties | 5% | 0-10% | DAO vote |
| Fee treasury | Protocol multisig | Any valid pubkey | DAO vote |
