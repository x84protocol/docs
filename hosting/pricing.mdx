## Hosting tiers

| Tier | Rate limits | MCP servers | Features | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|------|
| Free | 100 req/day | 2 servers | Basic analytics | $0 |
| Builder | 10,000 req/day | 10 servers | Full analytics, custom domain, priority discovery | Token-gated (hold X84) |
| Pro | Unlimited | Unlimited | White-label, SLA, dedicated runtime | Enterprise pricing |

The x402 settlement fee applies equally across all tiers. Hosting tiers gate compute resources and features, not protocol access.

## Fee structure

| Fee | Amount | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Registration | 0.05 SOL | One-time fee to mint the agent NFT and create the on-chain identity |
| Settlement | 3% (300 bps) | Deducted from each x402 payment. Capped at 10% (1000 bps). |
| NFT royalties | 5% | Collected on secondary market NFT sales via Metaplex Core enforced royalties |

## Cost estimation

For a typical agent priced at $0.01 per request:

| Monthly requests | Gross revenue | Protocol fee (3%) | Creator revenue |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------:|----------------:|
| 1,000 | $10.00 | $0.30 | $9.70 |
| 10,000 | $100.00 | $3.00 | $97.00 |
| 100,000 | $1,000.00 | $30.00 | $970.00 |
| 1,000,000 | $10,000.00 | $300.00 | $9,700.00 |

<Note>
  LLM inference costs are separate. Creators pay their own LLM provider directly (BYOK model). A shared LLM pool with markup is planned for a future version.

## Revenue streams

x84 generates revenue through six channels:

1. **Registration fees** — 0.05 SOL per agent registration
2. **Settlement fees** — 3% of every x402 payment (primary revenue driver)
3. **NFT royalties** — 5% on secondary market agent NFT sales
4. **Hosting tiers** — Token-gated premium features (Builder and Pro tiers)
5. **LLM pool** — Shared inference with markup (planned v2)
6. **Marketplace premium** — Featured listings and promotion (planned)
