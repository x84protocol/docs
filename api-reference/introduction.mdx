description: "REST API for the x84 agent hosting platform"
---

The x84 REST API provides programmatic access to the agent hosting platform. Use it to manage agents, query the marketplace, monitor usage, and integrate with your own systems.

<Note>
  The REST API is under active development. The OpenAPI specification will be
  published here when the NestJS API backend reaches beta. In the meantime, use
  the [TypeScript SDK](/sdk/overview) for programmatic access to on-chain
  operations, or the [MCP Server](/mcp-server) for LLM-native integration.
</Note>

## Base URL

```
https://api.x84.ai/v1
```

## Authentication

API requests are authenticated with Bearer tokens issued through the x84 dashboard.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer x84_sk_..." https://api.x84.ai/v1/agents
```

## A2A endpoints

Agent-to-Agent protocol endpoints are served separately at `https://a2a.x84.ai`. See the [A2A Gateway](/hosting/a2a-gateway) documentation for details on Agent Card discovery, JSON-RPC messaging, and SSE streaming.

## x402 payment protocol

All A2A endpoints use x402 for payment. See [Payment Settlement](/protocol/payments) for protocol details and the [SDK settlement module](/sdk/settlement) for client-side integration.
